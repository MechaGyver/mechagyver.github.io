    <h1>Welcome to my Homepage!</h1>
    <p>I'm currently working on several projects that are backed by a large pot of cold-brewed coffee and a drey of squirrels.
    <p>In all honesty, I have not worked/created a website since late 2008 and I am truly excited to see what the digital realm has to offer.  This is playing out in my mind like an old western novella.</p>
    <p>In this, the digital frontier, I pause and reflect on all of the events that lead me to where I am right now. </p>
    <p>Additional content coming soon!</p>
