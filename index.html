    <h1>Welcome to the Earth...Oh! Leaving already?</h1>
    <p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages and a fleet of squirrels--powered by Starbucks and the false promise to release The Nut Job 3: Nutrix Revolutions.</p>
    <p>In all honesty, I have not worked/created a website since late 2008 and I am truly excited to see what the digital realm has to offer.  This is playing out in my mind like an old western novella.</p>
    <p>In this, the digital frontier, I pause and reflect on all of the events that lead me to where I am right now. </p>
    <p>Additional content coming soon!</p>
